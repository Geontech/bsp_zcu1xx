\def\ZCUxxx{ZCU111}
\def\uart{JTAG UART}
\def\bootswitch{As mentioned in Table 2-4 of Xilinx's UG1271, set SW6 to 1110 for SD card boot mode. This means that the SW6's switch labeled 1 is `ON' and 2, 3, and 4 are `OFF'. See Figure~\ref{fig:top}.}
\def\tty{\code{\$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200}\\

Note: connecting the \ZCUxxx{} to a host via USB-UART will result in 4 \code{ttyUSB*} files in \code{/dev/}. The 0th one is NOT the one of interest here. Use the 1st one instead.}
